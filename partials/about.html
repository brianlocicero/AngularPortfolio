<h1>About</h1>
<p>I have over 6 years experience developing front-end UI and applications, mentoring junior developers, and tackling complex consumer facing products. I have extensive knowledge of HTML5, CSS & JavaScript (both core knowledge and frameworks/libraries), as well as basic knowledge of mobile (iOS/Android) development. My personal interest is computer graphics (e.g. Canvas/WebGL), animation and mobile UI. Beyond specific technologies, I always keep an eye user experience and business goals.</p>
